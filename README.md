# Some git commands used
- I used ``git init`` to initialize git
- I used ``git status`` to show the files that have been added and modified and are ready to be committed and files that are untracked.
- I used ``git add .`` to add files to the staging area to track changes
- I used ``git log --oneline`` to check history of commits in a simpler manner 
- I forked and cloned the W3schools' test repo [here](https://github.com/Dev-Elo-1505/w3schools-test.github.io.git]) using ``git clone`` for cloning
- I created a new branch called today-log using ``git branch [branch name]``
- I used ``git checkout`` to switch between branches
- I merged today-log branch to main branch using ``git merge today-log``
- I committed using ``git comit -m [commit message]``
- I used ``git pull`` to bring the changes on my repo to my local file
- I used ``git push`` to push the updated changes on my local file to the repo
